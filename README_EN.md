# AI Company OS

A lightweight operating system for a one-person AI company: specialists do deep work, project leads coordinate, independent reviewers verify, and the CEO handles cross-project decisions.

## Core flow

```text
User -> specialist (small task)
User -> project lead -> specialists (single-project task)
User -> CEO -> project leads -> specialists (cross-project decision)
```

Use the task card for routing, a project context pack for stable memory, and a delta handoff for collaboration. Keep private conversations, credentials, local paths, and business data out of this repository.

See `docs/` for architecture, routing, and memory rules. Templates are in `templates/`; role prompts are in `roles/`.
